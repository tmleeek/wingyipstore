The History of the Fortune Cookie - For many centuries the Chinese have marked special occasions and festivals, such as Harvest and New Year, with the giving and receiving of Lotus Nut Paste Moon Cakes. During the 13th and 14th centuries, when China was invaded and occupied by the Mongols, (who had no taste for Lotus Nut Paste), these Moon Cakes were used to hide messages informing of the date for an uprising against the invaders. Then a patriotic revolutionary, Chu Yuan Chuang, took on the disguise of a Taoist priest and entered occupied walled cities handing out the Moon Cakes. The uprising was successful and so the basis of the Ming Dynasty was formed. The transition from Moon Cakes to modern-day fortune cookies started during the hard days of the American Gold rush. Chinese men and women were emploted to build the great American railways through the Sierra Nevada to California. As they didn't have traditional Cakes to exchange at the Moon Festival, they instead put happy messages inside biscuits and thus the Fortune Cookie was born. When the Chinese first settled in San Francisco the custom continued, with cookies being made by hand until 1964 when first automated production began. Cookies are an ideal way to celebrate any occasion - traditionally eaten at the end of a Chinese Meal, they are also the perfect finish to your Dinner Party and an intriguing end to any evening","Water, wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, glucose, flavouring, raising agent: sodium carbonate, emulsifier: soya lecithin, colouring: ribloflavin",,Store in a cool dry place,,,,,,,,,,,3,,"Chadha Oriental Foods Ltd.
